				<h2>An unusual school</h2>
				<p id="right">
					42 doesn't have teachers, neither classrooms. Its pedagogy is unique :
					<b>Peer-to-peer learning</b>. Before that : here is the process of recruitment
					of the school.
					First of all, I succeed on a logic algoritmic test. The point is not about 
					how much programming langage do you handle, but your pure logic skills.
					Then, second step is the piscine (`pool`).<br>
					It consist on a full and intense month of coding. All days and all day long. I remember
					the first day, they left us at the cluster (the big place with all Macs) with only one 
					instruction : If there is something you don't know, ask your right mate. If he can't help
					you, then ask your left mate. If both of them don't know, ask Google.. Quite short right ?
					The algorithm evaluate our progression, check if we had a lot of interactions (helping 
					others and be helped), etc... Then two weeks after, you get the decisive email (I get the good one)</br></br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="second-part sub-project">
				<h2>A school designed like a game</h2>
				<p>
					We must earn correction points, by correcting others on their projects. And with thoses points,
					we're able to go through our projects. As you can see, it's a virtuous circle. The most important 
					thing I've learned it's how to learn. Be autodidact, and ask the good person the right question.
					The whole cursus is composed by projects, displayed as <a href="./images/holygraph.png" target="_blank">
					concentric circles</a>. Again, it's like in a game : You need to validate the 1st circle to access
					the 2nd one, and so on... To be able to do this, the school have to stay opened 24/7, all the year.
					It allow students to manage their planning as they wish, and it's a real heavy good point. Here is an
					non exhaustive list of projects:
				</p>
				<ul class="content">
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/ahocinemax/libft" target="_blank">libft		:</a> 1st project -> 
						Recode the libc, functions have same behaviour than originals
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/ahocinemax/minitalk" target="_blank">minitalk	:</a> Communication
						server using UNIX signals
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/ahocinemax/push_swap" target="_blank">push_swap	:</a> sorting
						algorithm with smart solver
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/ahocinemax/so_long" target="_blank">so_long		:</a> Code a 
						two dimensional game with miniLibX
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					To force students to manage their time, there is a system called Black Hole. It consist on a days countdown,
					starting at 77 days and decreasing each day by one. If I reach 0 days, <b>GAME OVER</b>. Each time i succeed
					on a project, I win X days (every project have its own value).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="ambitions sub-project">
				<h2>The professional side</h2>
				<p>
					The aim of the school is to learn on a professional environment. To do so, we use various tools as :
				</p>
				<ul class="content">
					<li>
						<b>Git</b> to manage our projects from school and on remote 
						<a href="https://github.com/ahocinemax/" target="_blank">(Link to my github)</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						We discuss trough <b>Discord</b> and <b>Slack</b> with specific channels
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The Peer-to-peer learning concept is extremely well working. The students and staff are split on 4
					coalitions. Each one got a color, a name, and a story. We need to achieve some quests to earn points,
					and avoid to be TIG (community work) by the staff.
					They also played a giant battleship on the cluster ! They printed a map of all computers at this stair,
					and then a tutor was trying to flow the ships, by manually turning off computers on remote. It was funny for some,
					and particulary disapointing others. In fact, the aim of this game was to encourage us to save our work as 
					frequently as possible.

				<h2>Development is about pedagogy</h2>
				<p>
					To understand basics of programmation, I found my best way : I explain it to a newbie. By
					making him/her understand what I'm trying to do step by step, it reveals what or where is the logical problem.
					I practiced it first with maths, during high school and college, but it tooked an other dimension
					at 42. So I decided to start learning children about algoritmic. It went trough Scratch. It's a web
					application which allows to animate characters by using blocks. Several items are present like loop,
					conditions, varaiables, list, etc...<br>
					I share with them all we did, as a correction. If you want, the
					<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ahocine" target="_blank">link is here</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="school-projects sub-project">
				<h2>What did I learned exactly ?</h2>
				<p>
					Children like easy things. They want to do their favorite videogame like Minecraft or Fortnite, but don't want to
					add theirselves a new subject. So it had to be playful, and progressive. It also improved my team work skills.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="ambitions sub-project">
				<h2>The professional side</h2>
				<p>
					I talked to several people since I start working. I'm now able to speak to anyone (no matter which social class).
